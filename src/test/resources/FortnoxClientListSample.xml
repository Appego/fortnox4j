    	FortnoxApiClients are the integration API clients, meaning the agent that
    	accesses a specific Fortnox client in order to read/write data to Fortnox
    	clients.
    	An API client has an ID and a corresponding clientSecret. This secret is the
    	secret of the actual API integration. The secret is combined with the specific
    	accessToken of a specific Fortnox client to gain access to that Fortnox client.
    	
    	There can be many ApiClients with different purposes and access rights. This is
    	why it's a list.

			using only the clientSecret and accessToken.
			However, currently, the organization number is used as a key to lookup
			clientInfo records, so currently it must be provided in this field.

            	FortnoxApiClient.
            	ClientSecret can also be supplied in this record, thus
